## Frontend

### General Guidelines

- Use Astro components (`.astro`) for static content and layout.
- Implement framework components in React only when interactivity is needed.

### Guidelines for Styling

#### Tailwind

- This project uses **Tailwind CSS v4**, with configuration defined mainly in `src/styles/global.css` and the Vite plugin `@tailwindcss/vite` (a classic `tailwind.config.*` file is optional and is not the primary source of truth).
- Use the `@theme` directive and CSS custom properties to define design tokens (colors, radius, spacing, etc.).
- Use the `@layer` directive to organize styles into components, utilities, and base layers where needed.
- Use arbitrary values with square brackets (for example `w-[123px]`) for precise one‑off designs, but prefer tokens defined via `@theme` when possible.
- Leverage Tailwind variants such as `dark:`, responsive variants (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, etc.), and state variants (`hover:`, `focus-visible`, `active`, etc.) for interactive and adaptive designs.

### Guidelines for Accessibility

#### ARIA Best Practices

- Use ARIA landmarks to identify regions of the page (main, navigation, search, etc.).
- Apply appropriate ARIA roles to custom interface elements that lack semantic HTML equivalents.
- Set `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` for expandable content like accordions and dropdowns.
- Use `aria-live` regions with appropriate politeness settings for dynamic content updates.
- Implement `aria-hidden` to hide decorative or duplicative content from screen readers.
- Apply `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` for elements without visible text labels.
- Use `aria-describedby` to associate descriptive text with form inputs or complex elements.
- Implement `aria-current` for indicating the current item in a set, navigation, or process.
- Avoid redundant ARIA that duplicates the semantics of native HTML elements.
